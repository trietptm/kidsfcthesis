\section{Conclusion}
A vast amount of new malware sample each day is the difficult problem in malware analysis. Our malware fast malware classification system is successful to classify unknown malware into malware family which have semantic characteristic. We strongly believe that our system is useful for malware analysis to determine malware behavior and semantic malware characteristic to more easily analyze a vast amount of malware.
However, there is a problem that our system use only malware meta-data and cannot detect the malware family which have same program structure.\\
Surprisingly, our system cannot be used to classify W32 malware which does not have the signature of PE file signature. 
 
\section{Future work}
Our system successfully classified unknown malware into malware family. In the future work, we use Windows API in order to make our system determined unknown malware into the malware families, which have similarity of program structure.
